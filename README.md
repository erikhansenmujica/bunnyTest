To run this project:

first: git clone --recursive https://github.com/erikhansenmujica/bunnyTest 

Then you have to enter to the three folders and run npm install and npm start in each one.

I used postgresql so you will have to create a database called bunny so the data can be stored.

And thatÂ´s it! :)
